# CloudSeis

CloudSeis is a cloud-based seismic data processing software based on the desktop app [BotoSeis](https://github.com/botoseis/BotoSeis)
<br />
CloudSeis is mainly a wrapper for [SeismicUnix](https://github.com/JohnWStockwellJr/SeisUnix) allowing usage through API and web UI, adding tooling for store, track and organize data processing steps.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

 - Main dependencies:
    - [SeismicUnix]() (There is a step to install it bellow)
    - [Docker]() (Necessary for quiky run)
    - [Unix]() Based system (SeismicUnix installationg script only work on [Debia]() based systens)
 - Opcional dependancies, for manual run only (docker handle they)
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.10.8 or above
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v16 or above
    - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v1.22.19 or above

#### Installing seismic unix

run the command line bellow on visit the oficial guide to manual install
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://gist.githubusercontent.com/botoseis/4ca681cb9ef706c1b8410153c6199cf2/raw/b16ad754839d1ca3657d8e8396db14f5ba791e6b/install_seismic_unix.sh)"
```

### Quicky start
   >  Requires **docker-compose**

Go to root and run the Makefile. It will make available the necessery services for end user.
```bash
make
```


For automate tests, make the test database available by runing:
```bash
make test
``` 

For manage or make new programs available, run the admin dashboard:
```bash
make adm
```


Each service can be run and managed individualy with docker-compose.

To manully run any instance without docker, check each folder `README.md`.


# Architeture

### Services

The project is divided in 4 services:
 - server <br />
   Base API that handle every persistent storage on the aplication
 - admin <br />
   Web interface that provides management of the programs available for the end user. The admin can create, delete and modify programs information. It will reflect in the end user view. 
 - webapp <br />
   The end user view. Where the avarage end user must interact with it's workflows, files and history information
 - seismic-webviz <br />
   Vizualization web interface. Usualy it opens as result of some action at the webapp, displaying visualization tools for the selected data or for the resulting data of some process.

Mostly every table have a column to identify who can access and modify each row.
